# 2024 Global Military Expenditure Dataset

## Overview  
This project explores global military spending across countries and continents using Python and Excel. It focuses on the strategic, economic, and geopolitical implications of defense budgets from a data-driven perspective. The goal is to extract actionable insights that help interpret the global distribution of military power and its relationship to GDP, population, and regional priorities. 

## Questions Addressed  
- Which countries have the highest and lowest military expenditures in 2024?  
- How does military spending relate to GDP and population in different regions?  
- Which continents allocate the largest share of their resources to defense?  
- What is the burden of military expenditure per citizen or as a % of GDP?  
- How do strategic priorities differ between developed and developing countries?

## Data Preprocessing  
The dataset was cleaned and enriched for deeper analysis. Preprocessing steps included:  
- Handling missing and inconsistent entries  
- Creating new columns for GDP share, population burden, and rankings  
- Formatting data types for compatibility in Excel and Python tools  

## Data Analysis and Visualizations  
Using Python libraries, the project analyzes:  
- Top and bottom countries by military expenditure  
- Correlation between defense budget and GDP or population  
- Continental comparison of defense spending  
- Scatter plots to visualize economic burden vs. military strength  
- Strategic outliers in global defense policy  

## Tools and Technologies  
- Python  
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Key Features  
- Quantitative analysis of military expenditure from a global perspective  
- Visual storytelling through charts, graphs, and pivot tables  
- Insights into economic burden and strategic defense allocation  
- Clean, reproducible code and organized files for analysis
